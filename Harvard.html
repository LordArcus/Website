            <h4>Why i choose Data Science?</h4>
            <p>
                In my third year of BSC, I got to know about C and learned it. Later, I taught myself Python. As I learned more about them, I got curious about what they could do. That’s when I discovered data science. When I found out that the field of data science is growing every day, it got me interested. I already knew about Google Assistant and Jarvis from Iron Man, and that sparked my curiosity about AI. I learned that to get into AI, you usually start with data science. I know they’re different, but they share some parts. And to teach AI, you need to understand the data it uses. That’s why I decided to learn data science first.

            <h4> Why i choose Harvard?</h4>
            <p>
                Back in my childhood, after diving into the magical world of Harry Potter, I couldn’t help but dream about attending a place like Hogwarts. Somehow, that dreamy feeling got intertwined with Harvard – like they shared some magic. So, Harvard became this big goal for me, even though I had no idea what subject to pick. I wasn’t super passionate about any specific field, and Harvard was mostly a wish in my head. Plus, studying abroad wasn’t on my radar until I stumbled upon Data Science. Suddenly, it felt like a golden ticket to Harvard, but there was a snag – our family was tight on money, and Harvard seemed like a distant star. Just when things felt a bit lost, I discovered Harvard offers financial help for students like us. There’s a catch, though – I need Harvard’s nod of approval for a scholarship. So, I’ve set my sights on the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, crossing my fingers for a full scholarship. I even jumped into the CS50 course of computer science to get a feel for computers and Harvard’s teaching style. I loved it, and now, I’m super pumped to make my dream of Harvard a reality!
