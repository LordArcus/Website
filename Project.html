            <h4>My projects</h4>
            <p>
                I’m just getting started in this field, and I haven’t tackled a ton of projects yet. I’m in the learning phase, soaking up new knowledge like a sponge. However, I do have a couple of projects under my belt. One was during my final year of BSC, and the other involved developing a web app.
            </p>
            <h4>Project related to Linear programming</h4>
            <p>
                The project I worked on was titled “A STUDY of a Small Village in Dakshinkali Municipality About the Water Distribution Network by Using Linear Programming”. In this project, I focused on five different nodes near the reservoir and formulated equations to find the minimum cost, with diameter, pressure, and velocity as decision variables. To solve these equations, I employed LINDO, and for verification and familiarity, l explored MATLAB, adding another language to my toolbox alongside C and Python. The result showed a slightly higher cost than previous research, attributed to the omission of certain variables, like not including all the nodes in the analysis.
            </p>
            <h4>Web app project</h4>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m diving into my second project – building a web app. It’s all made possible with Django and MYSQL. What’s cool is that there’s loads of coding involved, I’m always learning new things, and I get to meet other coders. Even though I haven’t teamed up on community projects yet, this solo one is keeping me busy. The goal of this web app is to support an “Automated Bus Fare System using RFID”. It gets GPS  data from special hardware. Users can make accounts, get RFID cards, and check out their profiles, travel history, fare rates, and balance. Right now, all the data stays on a local device. On the tech side, I’m using Python and picking up skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, SQL, and the Django framework. This project is also my introduction to Git and Github, and I’m using Ngrok to put my web app online. It’s hands-on learning, and I’m loving it!
