            <h4>Let me introduce myself!</h4>
            <p>
                Hey, I’m Saurav Acharya, and Nepal is where I call home. Specifically, I’m from this small village called Chhaimale, situated about 22km south of Kathmandu, the capital.  Chhaimale is part of the Dakshinkali Metropolitan, named after the Hindu goddess Dakshinkali. Now, my place is pretty neat–it’s close to the Dakshinkali Temple, and our village boasts some noteworthy spots like Dakshinkali Temple, Chaukot Devi Temple, Jatipokhari, and Sahid Smark. And, you know, if you ever plan to visit Nepal, there’s a whole treasure trove of beautiful places like Pokhara, Chitwan, Ilam, and Lumbini.
                <br><br>
                Now, let’s get personal.  We’re a family of four. First up, there’s my dad, Sudan Acharya, who’s out there doing the farming hustle. Then comes my mom, Kamala Acharya, who works in a factory producing all sorts of things from this fruit called “Lausi”. And rounding off the family is my younger brother, Pratik Acharya, who’s deep into his studies, tackling BBS at Tribhuvan University, and even daddling in German for extra spice.
                Onto the story of my life. I made my grand entrance into the world on the 17th day of Kartik in the year 2058, right smack at noon. Childhood? Well, I wasn’t exactly the studious type; I’d rather be outside playing football. Growing up in a middle-class setup meant no computer, and honestly, I didn’t grasp how crucial that would become later on.
                But my childhood, oh, it was a rollercoaster of fun. Marbles in winter, kite-flying sessions, and the traditional “ping” during Dashin were staples. River swimming was a must, and there were those classic moments of bunking classes and minor squabbles, but in the end, we always came back together.
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to when I was 14; that’s when I wrapped up my SLC from a local school. Big move, right? Packed my bags and headed to Kathmandu for higher education. My parents could only swing support for my science studies, and I found a study haven with my mother’s sisters. They set up this perfect environment. I had grand plans of diving into the world of Science because I was a math and science enthusiast in school. Black holes and time-related theories fascinated me, thanks to some Hollywood flicks. But, here’s the twist – no computer knowledge led me to opt for the Bio groups.
                Alright, let’s rewind to my Class 11 days – the first term exams were on the horizon, and that’s when the plot thickened. Picture this: the night before my physics exam, I was burning the midnight oil, studying until 11 pm. The next morning, I pulled an early bird move, waking up at 3 am to cram some more. Now, the excitement started kicking in. Fast forward to the exam hall, and that’s where the drama unfolded. Guess what? I forgot my calculator. Yep, brilliant move, right? As I received the physics question paper, reality hit me hard. The questions were nothing like what I expected, totally throwing me off. I had assumed they’d follow the same pattern as the Class 10 science question, but boy, I was wrong. To make matters worse, I hadn’t prepared for exams in English before (except for English itself), coming from a Nepali medium government school where everything was in Nepali.
                So, there I was, clueless about the question format, and the only question I managed to tackle was only half-solved. The saga continued in my other subjects, except for math – thankfully, I nailed that one.
                Result day approached, and I wasn’t ready to face the music. Instead, I decided to escape to my village. The first term exam? Nightmare material.
                But, you know what they say – every cloud has a silver lining. This whole experience taught me a valuable lesson:  going into any exam without proper preparation is a recipe for disaster. It emphasized the importance of gathering as much information as possible beforehand. In that situation, I had done the prep, but I lacked insight into the question pattern. Plus, the English exams were uncharted territory for me. Taking these lessons to heart, I addressed my shortcomings, improved my approach, and even joined tuition classes. The result? I successfully navigated and passed the Class 11 board exams. A real rollercoaster ride, but hey, you live, you learn!
                <br><br>
                This incident is just one among many I’ve faced – some similar, others even more challenging. The common thread is that each of these experiences has shaped my journey, bringing me to where I am today. Thanks to these events, I’ve found my place in the IT field and am fueled by the desire to delve deeper into this dynamic domain.
